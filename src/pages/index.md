    Flock Cover gives you tailored coverage, down to the exact hour you need it
    for.
  reasons:
    - text: >-
        Flock’s pricing is risk-dependent. So the safer you fly, the less you
        pay. It’s as simple as that.
      title: Fairer pricing
    - text: >-
        Pay for drone insurance only when you fly. Get covered for as little as
        one hour, or up to a day. You decide.
      title: Short-term insurance
    - text: >-
        Build your insurance from the ground up so you only pay for the cover
        you need.

      With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!

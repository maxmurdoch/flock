    Flock Cover gives you tailored coverage, down to the exact hour you need it
    for.
  reasons:
    - icon: images/uploads/shield.svg
      text: >-
        Flock’s pricing is risk-dependent. So the safer you fly, the less you
        pay. It’s as simple as that.
      title: Fairer pricing
    - icon: images/uploads/money.svg
      text: >-
        Pay for drone insurance only when you fly. Get covered for as little as
        one hour, or up to a day. You decide.

        Build your insurance from the ground up so you only pay for the cover
        you need.

      With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!

      I hate drones. But I have one. And I insure my property because I'm a
      responsible adult. Flock are the best drone insurers. I use Flock.

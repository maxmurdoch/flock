    that's tailored to your flight. At the most competitive price possible.

        Flock’s pricing is risk-dependent. So the safer you fly, the less you
        pay. It's as simple as that.

        Pay for insurance only when you fly. Get covered for one hour, or up to
        a day.

      With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!

stopWorrying:
  description: >-
    Flock Cover gives you the cover you need, down to the exact hour you need it
    for.
  reasons:
    - text: >-
        Flock’s pricing is risk-dependent. So the safer you fly, the less you
        pay. It’s as simple as that.
      title: Fairer pricing
    - text: >-
        Pay for insurance only when you fly. Get covered for as little as one
        hour, or up to a day. You decide.
      title: Short-term insurance
    - text: >-
        Get a real-time quote in 30 seconds. You can use the app to see where
        it’s safest, (and cheapest!) to fly.

      With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!

      I hate drones. But I have one. And I insure my property because I'm a

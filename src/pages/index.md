stopWorrying:
  description: >-
    The Flock Cover app uses real-time data to provide instant drone insurance
    that's tailored to your flight. At the most competitive price possible.
  reasons:
    - icon: images/uploads/shield.svg
      text: >-
        Flock’s pricing is risk-dependent. So the safer you fly, the less you
        pay. It's as simple as that.
      title: Fairer pricing
    - icon: images/uploads/money.svg
      text: >-
        Pay for insurance only when you fly. Get covered for one hour, or up to
        a day.
      title: Short-term insurance
    - icon: images/uploads/magnifying-glass.svg
      text: >-
        Customise your insurance on a per-flight basis, so you only pay for the
        cover you need.

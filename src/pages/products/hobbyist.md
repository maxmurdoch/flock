    Whilst it's not a legal requirement for recreational drone pilots to have
    insurance, it's important to recognise the risks. A flying robot with
    spinning propellers has the potential to cause some serious damage if
    something were to go wrong. 


    Flock's Public Liability insurance gives you peace of mind from the second
    you take off, and starts from just £2.95: the price of your morning coffee!

risk:
  description: >-
    With Flock Cover you get much more than just an insurance policy. The app
    analyses real-time data from your Flight Area to identify nearby risks;
    generating a unique Risk Report for each flight in seconds. Here's what we
    look out for:
  list:
    - icon: ../../images/uploads/icons-house.svg

        High-risk buildings such as schools, hospitals, prisons, and densely
        populated areas.
      title: Inhabited spaces
    - icon: ../../images/uploads/icons-circle.svg

        Including dangerous areas such as nuclear power plants, military
        airbases, and busy roads.
      title: Ground hazards

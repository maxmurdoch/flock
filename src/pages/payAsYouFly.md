    - body: >-
        The prices of our Pay-as-you-fly policies are calculated on a per-flight
        basis, and are proportional to how risky your flight is. This is
        calculated by analysing data such as:
          * **Pilot profile:** Number of hours you have flown, claims history.
          * **Drone details:** Its weight, top speed, maximum flight height etc.
          * **Environmental data:** Distance to ground hazards such as hospitals or schools.
          * **Real-time weather conditions:** Includes the real-time wind speed, and probability of rainfall in the area you’re flying in.
      title: How is the risk-dependent pricing calculated?
    - body: >-
        Yes, you can have peace of mind that our commercial and training
        Pay-as-you-fly policies are CAA approved and EC785/2004 compliant.
      title: Is Pay-as-you-fly drone insurance EC785/2004 compliant?
    - body: >-

        details’ in the main menu, and you’ll see a button that says ‘Get an
        insurance Cover Note’.
      title: How do I get proof-of-insurance for my PfCO application?

        recreational pilots are available throughout the UK and the Channel
        Islands. We also offer worldwide cover to commercial operators with a
        [Fly Unlimited](https://flockcover.com/flyunlimited) monthly

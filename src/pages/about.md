    We're Flock, an energetic, London-based startup working to make the world a
    smarter and safer place.


    We believe that insurance doesn't have to be boring. It can be smart, and
    powered by real-time data. It can fit in the palm of your hand. And it can
    even help to reduce your own risks. Since launching Flock Cover in January
    2018 we’ve helped thousands of commercial drone pilots fly safely, with
    insurance that’s as individual as their flights. We’ve also launched
    offerings for recreational pilots and trainee pilots. And by constantly
    listening and learning from our customers, we’ve released a bunch of cool
    features too - like [predictive risk
    analytics](https://blog.flockcover.com/see-the-future-with-flocks-flight-planning-tool-1507e2de5c81),
    and additional [equipment
    insurance](https://blog.flockcover.com/just-landed-accessory-insurance-627b04c985bd).


    Our technology and service is now transforming both the drone industry and
    the insurance industry - and we’re just getting started!

        scheduled up to 10 days in advance.

        Pay for insurance only when you fly, with no up-front costs. Flock’s
        pricing is risk-dependent, so the safer the flight, the less you pay.

        Fly with peace of mind knowing that Flock’s policies are EC785/2004
        compliant and approved by the CAA.

        Since you can pinpoint the cost of insurance for each job, you can
        easily pass the costs onto your clients.

    We're Flock, an energetic, London-based startup building the future of drone
    insurance…


    We believe that insurance doesn't have to be boring. It can be smart, and
    powered by real-time data. It can fit in the palm of your hand. And it can
    even help to reduce your own risks.


    Since launching Flock Cover in January 2018 we’ve helped thousands of
    commercial drone pilots fly safely, with insurance that’s as customised as
    their flights. We’ve also launched offerings for recreational pilots and
    trainee pilots. And by constantly listening and learning from our customers,
    we’ve released a bunch of cool features too - like predictive analytics, and
    additional equipment insurance.


    Our technology and service is now transforming both the drone industry and
    the insurance industry - and we’re just getting started!

        Policies range from 1-8 hours, and can be purchased on the spot, or
        scheduled up to 10 days in advance.

        Pay for insurance only when you fly, with no up-front costs. Flock’s
        pricing is risk-dependent, so the safer the flight, the less you pay.

        Fly with peace of mind knowing that Flock’s policies are EC785/2004
        compliant and approved by the CAA.

        Since you can pinpoint the cost of insurance for each job, you can
        easily pass the costs onto your clients.

        We know two jobs are never the same. Choose your liability limit on a
        per-flight basis, with options ranging from £1-10M.

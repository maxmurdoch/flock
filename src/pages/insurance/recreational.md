    Whilst it's not a legal requirement for hobbyist drone pilots to have
    insurance in the UK, it's important to recognise the risks: a flying robot
    with spinning propellers has the potential to cause some serious damage if
    something were to go wrong.


    That's where the Flock Cover app comes in. Our Public Liability policies
    cover you against 3rd party claims, giving you peace of mind from the second
    you take off. What's more, our policies are Underwritten by Allianz, the
    world's leading aviation insurer.

  description: >-
    With Flock Cover you get much more than just an insurance policy. The app
    analyses real-time data from your Flight Area to generate a unique Risk
    Report for each flight in seconds. Here's what we look out for:

        High-risk buildings such as schools, hospitals, prisons, and densely
        populated areas.
      title: Inhabited spaces

        Including dangerous areas such as nuclear power plants, military
        airbases, and busy roads.

        Be alerted to surrounding airports, and temporary restrictions of
        airspace to avoid flying illegally.
